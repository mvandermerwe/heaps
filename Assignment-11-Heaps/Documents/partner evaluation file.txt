Homework 11 - Partner Evaluation
My Name: Roman Clark
Partner: Mark Van der Merwe
Date:    April 14, 2017

Hours Worked on Project: 7 hours

Partner Score: 3 My partner did an equal amount of work to me.

Group Analysis:

Our group worked very well. It may be due to the fact that this was one of the easier assignments,
but we ran into no issues, and Mark was a great partner for encouraging testing as we went, commenting
as we went, and getting work done in a timely manner. We both watched the videos beforehand and
definitely felt prepared for this assignment. The analysis was sort of extensive, but the group coding
went well, and unlike previous assignments, we were able to do 100% of the coding together.
